# A Visualization of Electric Scooters in Louisville, KY

## Setup

You need to run an http server so the web page can connect to the local data
stored as a csv in the `data` directory.

If you have Python 3, the easiest way to do this is to run `python3 -m
http.server` and navigate to `localhost:8000` in a web browser. This web app was
tested using Safari and Firefox but it should work in all major browsers.

## Data

All the data was obtained from the [Louisville Metro Open Data](https://data.louisvilleky.gov) website.
